DYO WINDOWS WORKER - AERENDER VERBOSITY FIX UPDATE
==============================================================

This is for a computer that has ALREADY set up DYO Worker once before
(you already ran DYO-Worker-Setup.bat and it said "Setup complete").

You will NOT be asked for a registration code. This does not create a
new DYO Worker connection - it updates the one you already have.

WHAT TO DO
-----------
1. Extract this ZIP (keep all the files together in one folder).
2. Double-click DYO-Worker-AerenderVerbosity-Update.bat
3. Done - it updates the program files and restarts DYO Worker
   automatically. No terminal knowledge needed, no password needed.

If it says "No saved worker registration was found", this computer never
completed the original DYO-Worker-Setup.bat, or its saved registration was
removed - use the full DYO Worker setup package instead of this one in
that case.

WHAT THIS UPDATES
-------------------
Fixes every Complete Preview and render attempt failing immediately with
"aerender SYNTAX ERROR: Bad value for -verbose." - the Worker was sending
an invalid logging-detail value to AE's own render command. This update
corrects it to the real value AE recognizes. Nothing about the project,
composition, template names, or output location changes.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT TOUCH
---------------------------
- Your existing DYO Worker registration/identity - kept exactly as-is.
- No new registration code is asked for or used.
- No Windows account password is asked for or stored.
- Your .env configuration file - not rewritten at all by this update.
- No After Effects project is opened, changed, or run against by this
  update, or by anything it installs. Nothing in this update ever asks
  ae-mcp to do anything - it only updates program files and restarts
  DYO Worker, which then reports its normal status on its own.
- Any scene-editing or asset-mapping operation - this update has nothing
  to do with any of them, and never runs them.
