.SYNOPSIS
  DYO Windows Worker - First Preview regeneration schema update, for an
  ALREADY-REGISTERED install. Double-click DYO-Worker-PreviewRegen-Update.bat
  instead of running this file directly.

.DESCRIPTION
  Ships the "Regenerate First Preview" support to an already-registered
  machine's EXECUTE_FRAME handling. This fixes a real production incident
  (2026-09-09): the dashboard's "Regenerate First Preview" action (which
  recaptures a preview frame from an already-mutated, already-safety-
  verified working copy, applying ZERO new edits) was correctly accepted
  by the server (API), but the WORKER on this machine was still running
  an OLDER build that predates this feature - its own copy of the shared
  job-payload schema still required at least one operation and rejected
  the new, optional `previewOnly`/`previewTimestampSeconds` fields
  outright, failing the job with an INVALID_PAYLOAD error. This is a
  packaging/deployment gap, not a defect in the fix itself - the API side
  already worked correctly.

  This update makes the Worker's own EXECUTE_FRAME payload validation
  accept a `previewOnly: true` job: zero operations, zero
  approvedMappingIds, a real existing working-copy hash, and a chosen
  `previewTimestampSeconds` - opening the session's already-mutated
  working copy (the exact same safety-fixed open-project flow, and the
  exact same independent source-immutability re-verification, as every
  other EXECUTE_FRAME job) purely to recapture a fresh preview frame,
  never to make a new edit.

  This script itself never runs EXECUTE_FRAME, never connects to ae-mcp,
  and never opens or touches any After Effects project - it only updates
  program files and restarts the worker. The worker's own heartbeat
  (visible in the log tail this script prints at the end) is what confirms
  Worker/AE/MCP status afterward - nothing here fabricates or pre-checks
  that.

  Includes `npm install` (like every prior *-Update.ps1 in this folder)
  so this update is correct and self-contained regardless of exactly
  which prior update this computer has already received. Still never
  touches .env: DYO_API_URL, AE_PATH, AE_MCP_PATH, and WORK_ROOT are all
  left exactly as they already are.

  Safety, same as every prior *-Update.ps1 in this folder:
    - never asks for or stores a Windows account password.
    - never asks for a registration code - if no worker-credentials.json
      is found, this STOPS with a clear message instead of silently
      registering a new, duplicate worker identity.
    - WORKER_ID/WORKER_TOKEN are never read, written, or passed as
      arguments here - this script never even opens worker-credentials.json,
      it only checks that the file exists.
    - never runs EXECUTE_FRAME or any AE-mutating tool - this update only
      installs the fix; nothing in this script calls it.
    - installed files remain restricted (via NTFS ACLs) to the current
      Windows user and SYSTEM.

  Where the DYO Worker program files are installed.
